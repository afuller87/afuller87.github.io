## Simon Memory Game
Simon Memory Game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that tests a players ability to remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors. The game features four colorful buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up in a specific sequence. The goal is to repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level. Be careful, though! One wrong move, and the player will have to restart the sequence. Reach a score of 10 to claim victory!

## How to Play
1. Press the "Play" button to start the game. 
2. Memorize the sequence of lights and sounds. 
3. Repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding quadrants.
4. If you make a mistake, you will hear an error sound with a "NO!" alert.
5. Reach level 10, and you will see "WIN!"
## Strict Mode
1. Enable "Strict Mode" by toggling the "STRICT" checkbox.
2. In "Strict Mode", if you make a mistake, the game will reset, and you'll have to start from 0.
3. Challenge yourself to complete the game without making a single mistake!
